Please submit issues <a href="https://github.com/katzwebservices/Bigcommerce-WordPress-Plugin/issues?state=open">on the plugin's Github development page</a>.

= This plugin uses PressTrends =
By installing this plugin, you agree to allow gathering anonymous usage stats through PressTrends. The data gathered is the active Theme name, WordPress version, plugins installed, and other metrics. This allows the developer of this plugin to know what compatibility issues to test for.

To remove PressTrends integration, add the code to your theme's functions.php file:

`
add_action('plugins_loaded', 'remove_CTCTCF7_presstrends_plugin', 20);
function remove_CTCTCF7_presstrends_plugin() {
	remove_action('admin_init', array('CTCTCF7', 'presstrends_plugin'));
}
`

= What are the system requirements =

* Requires PHP version 5. If your web host does not support PHP5, please contact your host and see if they can upgrade your PHP version.
* Activate `curl` if your web host doesn't already have it running. Generally this can be done at no cost.

= When should I rebuild my products/cache? =

* Rebuild your products list whenever you upgrade the plugin, or whenever you add new products or change existing product names, links, or images within your store.

= How can I replace the "No Image Available" image with my own? =

`
add_filter( 'bigcommerce_no_image', 'replace_bigcommerce_no_image_with_my_image');
function replace_bigcommerce_no_image_with_my_image($content) {
	return '<img src="http://example.com/my-no-image-image.jpg" alt="No image available" />';
}
`

__To modify the output:__
